It's a project for Molecular Biology Plotting with Python, started on Nov 5th, 2019.

Motivation: There are many killer packages in R, like circulize, complexheatmap and etc., which are missing in Python. Why I don't play with R is that the data structure and syntax in R are too confusing, and the package dependency managemnet in R (especially Bioconductor) is a disaster. In contrast, data visulization implement in Python can be more efficient, more logical and more portable. Python package dependencies, like matplotlib, are more reliable under better organizing by the Python community. 

I pursue perfect figures at single pixel resolution, so some codes in this package is just for fixing small flaws in the previously existing solutions. I am unable to reinvent all the wheel in those killer packages; and I am not a full-time bioinformatician only for data visulization. So I would slowly update this package when I had the demands or someone requested.

Plans:
(0) A better grid system for complex objects.
(1) Friendly CDF plotting (not KDE).
(2) Circulizing plots.
(3) Heatmap, a bit complex.
